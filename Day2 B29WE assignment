Difference between document and window objects

Document Object-

It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
It is always loaded inside the window.
All of the tags and elements in the Html are part of the document object 
It is the object of window property.
We can access the document from a window using the window. document
The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
syntax:
document.propertyname;
example:
document.title :  will return the title of the document

Window Object

Window represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   
It is the object of the browser.
It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser
Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object
syntax:
window.propertyname;
example:
window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
